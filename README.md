# Jamb
Jamb(eng. Yatzhy) is a game with dice, pen and paper. The game was made for practice purposes, made with Unity and C#.
I made it so that it can be played on the phone, and the game calculates the score and everything.  
>the rules of the game can be found on wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee
